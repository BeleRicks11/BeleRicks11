# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello to everyone, I'm **Riccardo Fava**, constantly looking for new challenges since **1998**. I'm a student recently graduated at the **University of Parma** in **Computer Engineering**, with a grade of 110/110 cum laude. Currently I'm studying **Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Bologna** for my master's degree. 
I deeply love **AI** and I think that it can help us to make our life better. My greatest passions are computer science and sports.

# ðŸ”­ But I fell in love with AI...
## In recent years the thing that most attracted me has been Artificial Intelligence. 
#### In particular I studied classical AI such as Graph Plan, Knowledge bases and Bayesian Networks. Then I focused my attention on Machine learning and Deep techniques. I applied these approaches studying Computer vision, Natural Languages Processing and Neural Networks in general. 
##### I'm familiar with these technologies:
* Jupyter
* Scikit-learn
* NumPy and Pandas
* PyTorch
* Keras
* NLP libraries like Spacy and Flair

The project that I've realized for my first-level degree thesis is a **tool for automatic de-identification of health documents**.
